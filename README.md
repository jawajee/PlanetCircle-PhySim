# PlanetCircle-PhySim
This is a repository dedicated to my project 'PlanetCircle'. My aim in this project is to succesfully SIMULATE SIMPLE PLANETARY MOTION and provide the simulated data to the user. For implementing, calculation and manipulating FORCES i am using VECTORS. This goal is captured in this 'Vectors' branch.
